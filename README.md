# FIFA Club World Cup 2025 — Real Data Dashboard & Analysis

This is a **fan-built, real-data project** exploring the expanded Club World Cup format through match-by-match stats, team market values, and tournament outcomes — all compiled into a storytelling dashboard and this repo.

## What’s inside
- `/data/` — **CWC FIFA 2025 V2.xlsx** (matches, results, goals, stats, teams, venues)
- `/docs/` — **FIFACWC2025.pdf** (export of the dashboard), **CWC2025_Report.md**, **Data_Dictionary.md**
- `/powerbi/` — PBIX file (if you want to include it)
- `README_GitHub.md` (this file)

## Headline KPIs
- Teams: **32** | Confederations: **6**
